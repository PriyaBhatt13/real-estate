Assumption:

1. Since there was no separate field for postalCode I have added one extra field, after retrieving data from serverResponse file provided in the task.

2. I have added filter capability at client side.

3. serverResponse.json file had few commas(,) missing. I have corrected it to make it usable.

4. Since pie chart was required to be built I went ahead with using d3 to achieve the same.

5. I have used core css framework mentioned in assignment . http://www.static-immobilienscout24.de/fro/core/2.3.0/documentation/html/index.html


Steps required for production readiness, listed in priority(Functionality wise all the mentioned requirements are fulfilled)

1. Filters Overlay popOver and animation UI part

2. Animation of pie chart when data changes after applying filters

3. Small Viewport gap between pie chart and properties list

3. CI/CD integration
